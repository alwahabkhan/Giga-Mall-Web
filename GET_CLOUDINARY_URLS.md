# How to Get Cloudinary URLs for Your Files

## Quick Steps

1. **Go to Cloudinary Media Library**: https://console.cloudinary.com/console/media_library
2. **Find your files** - Search for files like:
   - `Giga Mall_.png` (or `Giga_Mall_.png`)
   - `gigamallvideo.mp4`
   - `NIKE_-_WMoN.jpg`
   - `ADIDAS.jpg`
   - `Sephora_2_1.jpg`
3. **Click on each file** to open it
4. **Copy the URL** from the "URL" or "Secure URL" field
5. **Share at least 3-4 URLs** with me (including logo and video)

## What the URLs Look Like

Your Cloudinary URLs might look like one of these patterns:

**Pattern 1 - With version:**
```
https://res.cloudinary.com/dcfe3424s/image/upload/v1764942385/Giga_Mall_xkykpq.png
```

**Pattern 2 - Without version:**
```
https://res.cloudinary.com/dcfe3424s/image/upload/Giga_Mall_.png
```

**Pattern 3 - Transformed filename:**
```
https://res.cloudinary.com/dcfe3424s/image/upload/Giga_Mall_xkykpq.png
```

**Pattern 4 - In a folder:**
```
https://res.cloudinary.com/dcfe3424s/image/upload/images/Giga_Mall_.png
```

## What I Need From You

Please provide:
1. **Logo URL**: The full Cloudinary URL for `Giga Mall_.png`
2. **Video URL**: The full Cloudinary URL for `gigamallvideo.mp4`
3. **2-3 Image URLs**: Examples like `NIKE_-_WMoN.jpg`, `ADIDAS.jpg`, `Sephora_2_1.jpg`

Once I have these, I can:
- Identify the pattern
- Update the code automatically
- Fix all the 404 errors

## Alternative: Check Public ID

If you can't find the files by name:
1. In Cloudinary Media Library, look at the "Public ID" column
2. The Public ID is what comes after `/upload/` in the URL
3. Share a few Public IDs and I can help map them
